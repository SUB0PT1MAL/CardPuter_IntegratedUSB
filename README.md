This is not a manual, i will descriove the parts used and not much more.

## CardPuter Integrated USB

I designed a back cover for the CardPuter to integrate a retractable usb cable to it, but it also requires some tinkering and sourcing of parts.

## Parts
- 3D printed cardputer back
- Kensington K72339 internal parts (retractable usb cable)
- Low profile cable
- DYI usb-c headers (one very low profile recomended)
- battery 800mah 30x42mm x2
